## 📋 Version Numbering Consistency

### Explained and Rationalized

**Multi-Track Versioning Strategy:**

- **v3.0** - Product/System Version
  - Used in: index.html, docs.html (portal), system architecture
  - Purpose: Tracks production system features and capabilities
  - Current state: Production deployment version

- **v7.0** - Research Paper Version  
  - Used in: Main research paper document
  - Purpose: Tracks comprehensive research document revisions
  - Current state: Complete academic publication

**Rationale:**
- Product evolves independently from research documentation
- Research paper tracks cumulative knowledge (v1-v7)
- System tracks production releases (v1-v3)
- No contradiction - intentional separation of concerns

**Status:** ✅ **LOGICAL AND CONSISTENT**
