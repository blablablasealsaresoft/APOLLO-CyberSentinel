  async initiateCollection(triggerEvent, biometricAuth) {
    // Verify biometric authentication
    if (!await this.verifyForensicAccess(biometricAuth)) {
      throw new Error('Forensic access denied - biometric verification failed');
    }
    
    // Initialize chain of custody
    const chainOfCustody = await this.initializeChainOfCustody(triggerEvent);
    
    // Execute NIST SP 800-86 collection sequence
    const evidencePackage = {
      incidentId: triggerEvent.incidentId,
      collectionTimestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      evidence: {}
    };
    
    try {
      // Phase 1: CPU State (0-10ns volatility)
      evidencePackage.evidence.cpuState = 
        await this.collectCPUState();
      
      // Phase 2: Memory Dump (0-10s volatility)
      evidencePackage.evidence.memoryDump = 
        await this.collectMemoryDump();
      
      // Phase 3: Network State (0-30s volatility)
      evidencePackage.evidence.networkState = 
        await this.collectNetworkState();
      
      // Phase 4: Process State (0-5min volatility)
      evidencePackage.evidence.processState = 
        await this.collectProcessState();
      
      // Phase 5: File System (persistent)
      evidencePackage.evidence.fileSystemState = 
        await this.collectFileSystemState();
      
      // Phase 6: Registry/Configuration (persistent)
      evidencePackage.evidence.registryState = 
        await this.collectRegistryState();
      
      // Finalize evidence package
      await this.finalizeEvidencePackage(evidencePackage, chainOfCustody);
      
    } catch (error) {

```javascript
// Biometric Authentication for Forensic Access
async verifyForensicAccess(requiredLevel = 1) {
  const authMethods = [];
  
  // Level 1: Basic forensic access
  if (requiredLevel >= 1) {
    authMethods.push(
      await this.biometricAuth.verifyFingerprint(),
      await this.biometricAuth.verifyFaceRecognition()
    );
  }
  
  // Level 2: Critical evidence handling
  if (requiredLevel >= 2) {
    authMethods.push(
      await this.biometricAuth.verifyVoiceRecognition()
    );
  }
  
  // Level 3: Legal proceedings preparation
  if (requiredLevel >= 3) {
    authMethods.push(
      await this.hardwareToken.verify(),
      await this.digitalSignature.generate()
    );
  }
  
  // All authentication methods must succeed
  return authMethods.every(method => method === true);
}
```
